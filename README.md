# vaxman
A different version of Pacman

This project is my solution to Electronic Arts Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program's Task 1. The code is edited from https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman to fit a different set of rules of the game. The media found in this folder is subject to the Creative Commons Licence and can be found in the original author's repo as well.

New rules:
* Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
* Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
* Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
* The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.
